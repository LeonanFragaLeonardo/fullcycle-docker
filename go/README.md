# Description
This repo contains just 3 files.

1. hello-world.go
2. hello-world
3. Dockerfile
4. Dockerfile.prod

The first one (`hello-world.go`) is a hello-world file containing a source code that prints a message.

The second one (`hello-world`) is the binary file generated by go compiler.

The third one (`Dockerfile`) contains a docker image with the compiled hello world.

The fourth one (`Dockerfile.prod`) contains a docker image with two stages: 
1. Compile our .go file
2. Get the binary file generated from the Build Stage and run it in a lightweight Docker stage.
